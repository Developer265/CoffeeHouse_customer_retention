Coffee House is a multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle, Washington. It is the world's largest coffeehouse chain. We have a large customer base and have consistently experienced high retention rates in the past.  Over the past year, Coffee House noticed a decline in the number of repeat customers and a corresponding decline in revenue. After reviewing customer feedback and conducting surveys, they have determined that the decline in retention rates is likely due to a combination of factors, including a lack of variety in our product offerings, poor customer service, and increased competition from other retailers. They have decided to conduct a data analysis project to better understand the factors contributing to the decline in retention rates and identify potential solutions to improve retention and increase revenue. 

As a data analyst, the objective is to implement an end-to-end data analysis project to understand the factors that are contributing to this decline and identify potential solutions to improve retention. We are required to undertake the following steps to identify potential solutions to improve retention for Coffee House using Python and Power BI: 

1. Cleaning and preparing the given dataset for analysis.
2. Exploring data to identify trends and patterns. 
3. Developing solutions to the given problem statement in the light of your data insights using visualizations.
